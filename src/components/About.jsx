          <p className='fs-5'>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, This is Hassen, a passionate Software Engineering graduate from Debre Berhan University.

            Over the past five years, Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in software development, with a special interest in backend technologies. I love solving real-world problems with clean, efficient codeâ€”and I'm always exploring better ways to build systems.

            ðŸŽ“ For my final year project, I developed KirayZone, a rental property management platform built to simplify how people list and find rental properties. I also interned at INFONANS, where I gained practical experience working on real-life systems.

            ðŸ’» I enjoy working on challenging backend problems, APIs, and database design. Iâ€™m currently looking for backend development opportunities where I can learn from experienced teams, contribute meaningfully, and grow as a developer.

            Outside of code, I value curiosity, teamwork, and continuous learning. Let's connect and build something great together!</p>
